# yolo_nsfw_implementation
This is an implementation of the yolov5 repository that was created with censorship in mind.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Objective of software:

Creation of bounding box around NSFW part of an image or a video. This is an extension of this repository: https://github.com/aarda55/NSFW-detector-model

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# End of progress:

yolo implementation can with extreme high precision draw bounding boxes in validation images and videos.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Future plan:

No future plan intended due to this being purely for research purposes and testing yolov5's performance in low training data situation (approximatly 100 training images were used).
